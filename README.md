# These Are Me*



A personal exploration of identity through interactive visuals. As you hover over "these are me", fragments of who I am appear and dance with your cursor, each image cycling through moments, interests, and pieces of my identity.

## The Experience
Move your cursor over the text to reveal a sequence of images that follow your movement. Each image represents different facets of my identity, from artistic explorations to captured moments, cycling through:
- Chromatic aberrations that blur the lines between digital and analog
- Kazakhstani landscapes 
- Experimental photography playing with blur and motion
- Digital glitches that represent my love for the imperfect
- Much more Xp

A subtle audio layer can be toggled with the mute button, adding another dimension to the experience.

## Behind the Scenes
Built with React/Next.js magic, brought to life with Framer Motion and GSAP animations, styled with SCSS, and topped with a touch of Web Audio API for sound interaction.
